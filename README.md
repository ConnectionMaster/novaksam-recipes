# Recipes

This is the repo for Sam Novak's modifed JSS recipes that are setup to be used with my updates to JSSImporter (pull request pending).

The recipes must be kept in the root folder so that it can correctly access template, script and image folders.

Requires the following repos: scriptingosx, golbiga, hansen-m, jleggat, cgerke-recipes, nmcspadden, jessepeterson
