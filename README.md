# Recipes

This is the repo for Sam Novak's modifed JSS recipes that are setup to be used with my updates to JSSImporter (pull request pending).

The recipes must be kept in the root folder so that it can correctly access template, script and image folders.

Requires the following repos: 

autopkg: AdobeAIR, FlashPlayerExtractPackage, AdobeReader, Dropbox, Evernote, Firefox, GoogleChrome, Handbrake, OracleJava7, OracleJava8, sassafras-k2client, Silverlight, Skype, TheUnarchiver, VLC

hansen-m: AdobeDigitalEditions, OracleJava8JDK

    hansen-m is currently the only repo offering pkg for AdobeDigitalEditions and Oracle JDK 8

    Jleggat is the only repo currently offering Shockwave Player.

    Scriptingosx offers a number of AppStore pieces of software, along with some additional pkg recipes that are only offered there (currently)

nmcspadden: appstore

    Nmcspadden offers the appstore recipe, which is super useful when packaging appstore software. I use it multiple times.

cgerke-recipes: GitHub, GoogleDrive, Wireshark

    Cgerke-recipes offers a PKG for GitHub, GoogleDrive and Wireshark, which I would otherwise have to pull from at least 2 other repos.
